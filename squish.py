# Ok so what is it that we want to do we want to take a set of strata like differnet colors of clay
#and then stretch them out
#then fold them over
#and smush them again

#1. we need to seam carve? wait do we?
# maybe we can do the stretchin gfirst.
#2. fold this part seems maybe difficult?
#3. put a copy back on top. this seems legit.

# So first
